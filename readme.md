# @typed/fx

`Fx` is a toolkit for composing synchronous, asynchronous, and event-based programs using reactive programming.

It is built directly atop of [Effect-ts](https://github.com/Effect-TS/core) an inherits all of its capabilities
while being able to be bi-directionally converted `Effect <-> Fx`. `Fx` is intended to be the shorthand for plural form of `Effect` "Effects".
